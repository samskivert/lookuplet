Lookuplet
---------

This GNOME applet provides a unified interface for looking things up.
There are many applications (desktop and web-based) in which you enter
some text and they return some information based on that text. Examples
include:

  * Looking a word up in a dictionary
  * Performing a web search
  * Performing a more specific search (searching Debian packages or on
    freshmeat.net, etc.)

The lookuplet aims to make all of those services readily accessible in as
efficient a manner as possible.

A text entry box is provided on the GNOME panel and you simply enter text
into that box and then press whatever action key combination you have
defined for a particular service to initiate the lookup. This interface is
based on the emacs principle of typing as few characters as possible to
perform tasks that are done frequently. I find myself looking things up in
various applications all of the time and the overhead of creating a new
browser window, selecting a bookmark, clicking into the text entry field
and then pressing submit struck me as tremendously inefficient.

Feedback on the program is welcome. Additional information and the latest
