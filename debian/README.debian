lookuplet
---------

This utility provides a unified interface for looking things up.

When invoked, the lookuplet grabs the current selection and sticks it into
a text field for potential editing. You then press a key combination that
you have previously configured and the text is sent either as an argument
to an application or URL encoded and substituted into a URL which is then
opened with your preferred web browser.
