	* src/lookuplet.c: Got support for running as an applet working
	again and modified the code to autodetect whether we're being run
	as an applet.

	* projects/lookuplet/src/lookuplet.c:
	Now that we're not an applet, we need to call gnome_init() rather than
	gtk_init(). Also slipped in some conditionals for the NLS stuff.

	* projects/lookuplet/acconfig.h, projects/lookuplet/configure.in:
	Minor configuration to make things work. I dislike the cargo cult nature
	of my approach toward autoconf, but I can't be bothered to dive deeply
	enough into the whole business to sort out all the jockeying that GNOME
	and the various other layers are doing with it.

	* projects/lookuplet/.cvsignore, projects/lookuplet/Makefile.am, projects/lookuplet/acconfig.h, projects/lookuplet/configure.in, projects/lookuplet/src/Makefile.am:
	Modifications to build lookuplet like a GNOME app rather than an applet.

	* projects/lookuplet/src/querybox.c:
	Exit after launching unless we're being compiled in applet mode (which
	isn't fully reinstated yet anyway).

	* projects/lookuplet/src/querybox.c:
	Prune whitespace from the end of the selection before inserting it into
	the lookuplet text widget.
