Building lookuplet
------------------

lookuplet is in the process of being rewritten in C++ using GLADE to
autogenerate code for the UI. As such you will need a variety of libraries
installed to build the program.

I use Debian Woody and I believe apt-get installing the following packages
will get you to where you need to be:

  gnome-common
  automake
  autoconf
  libgtk2.0-dev
  libgnomemm2.0-dev
  libgnomeuimm2.0-dev

I'm not sure whether there will be some missed dependencies, let me know
if you start from scratch and find some.

With that installed, invoke:

% ./autogen.sh

which will do a bunch of stuff and eventually run ./configure. You can
pass arguments to ./autogen.sh like --prefix to install somewhere other
than /usr/local. Then you can:

% make

which should build lookuplet which you can attempt to run like so:

% ./src/lookuplet

If that seems to work, then you can install it with:

% make install

Please let me know if you find that I've overlooked some build
requirements or instructions.

Thanks,
