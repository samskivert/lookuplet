Building lookuplet
------------------

lookuplet is now written in Python, using the Python/Gnome and Pythong/GTK
bindings. Thus, there is no building of lookuplet, but you will need a few
things installed to run it:

    Python       http://www.python.org/
    GTK+         http://www.gtk.org/
    gnome-libs   http://www.gnome.org/
    gnome-python http://www.gnome.org/

I use Debian Woody and I believe apt-get installing the following packages
will get you to where you need to be:

     python-gnome

I'm not sure whether there will be some missed dependencies, let me know
if you start from scratch and find some. lookuplet doesn't depend on any
special GNOME services, just the configuration stuff (gnome_config) and
some compound GTK widgets (like property_box).

Everything else should work out of the box. If you invoke 'make install'
it will attempt to install lookuplet int /usr/local, which can be changed
by setting DESTDIR in your environment or specifying its value to make on
the command line.

Please let me know if you find that I've overlooked some build
requirements or instructions.

Thanks,
