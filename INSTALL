Building lookuplet
------------------

It is necessary to have the GNOME development libraries installed to build
lookuplet. Only the following libraries are required:

    Glib        >= 1.2.1
    GTK         >= 1.2.1
    Imlib       >= 1.9.2
    gnome-libs  >= 1.2.1

These are available from the GNOME CVS repository
(http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html) but you may wish to install
packages provided by your favorite free operating system vendor instead.

I use Debian Woody and I believe apt-get installing the following packages
will get you to where you need to be:

     libgnome-dev
     libgtk1.2-dev

I'm not sure whether there will be some missed dependencies, let me know
if you start from scratch and find some. lookuplet doesn't depend on any
special GNOME services, just the configuration stuff (gnome_config) and
some compound GTK widgets (like property_box).

Once you have the necessary libraries, you can simply invoke:

# ./configure
# make

Everything else should work out of the box.

Please let me know if you find that I've overlooked some build
requirements.
